I didn’t know where to start so I signed up for Free Code Camp &amp; did 33 lessons of Responsive Web Design. I also signed up for GitHub &amp; created my first repo. Pushing beyond 💯!!</p>&mdash; Jose D. Sanchez (@JDS_85) <a href="https://twitter.com/JDS_85/status/1559571058742665219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2022</a></blockquote>

I finally learned how to install git in windows powershell. Not sure, but this all feels like coding to me!</p>&mdash; Jose D.

I’ve been studying git forever. Had a breakdown about my age and coding.😭 Years learning without earning! But the good people at the FCC discord reminded me: “we have immense value because we’ve invested in ourselves. Don’t ever forget that.”</p>&mdash; Jose D.

Some what figured out how to use ssh in powershell. Learned that all command lines are not created equally. Still need to learn how to copy content to a clipboard from the powershell. <a href="https://t.co/2gueLmjl2k">https://t.co/2gueLmjl2k</a></p>&mdash; Jose D.
